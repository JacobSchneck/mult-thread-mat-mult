# About

An voyage into rust's thrading api.

## TODOs
1) Make a simple matrix object (complete)
2) Simple naive matrix multiplication (complete)
3) Naive multi-threaded matrix multiplication (semi-complete -> needs more robust testing)
4) Divide and conquer matrix multiplication (incomplete)
5) Multi-threaded divide and conquer matrix multiplcation (incomplete)
6) Bonus: benchmark each algorithms performance and plot against eachother
